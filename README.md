# Welcome to Python Engineering!

Howdy! I'm James Allen, the new Python Instructor at the Durham campus of The Iron Yard. I've been teaching and using Python for 7 years, though this is my first cohort with TIY.

Over the next 12 weeks we're going to cover a lot of material, seeing a lot of different ways in which Python is used, and working on a lot of different projects to build out your portfolios. I'm really excited to see what you all come up with.

## Submitting assignments

Inspired by TIY's own David Rogers, we're going to try submitting assignments using the GitHub issues tracker. This will let you quickly measure your progress at a glance, and streamline feedback from me. More details in [assignment 00](00--Ready-Steady-Go/)!
