# 00 -- Ready Steady Go

In this assignment, you're going to practice the way we'll be handing in assignments, and you're also going to ensure that some basic preliminary work is completed. :bird: :bird: :bomb:

Here's the cool thing - if you did the prework, you should have some of these tasks done already, so you can go ahead and check those off right away!

## Back to Basics (Optional)

If you're brand new to the Mac, you're probably already getting a bit confused by the differences in conventions and crazy symbols. _Don't Panic!_ There's [a great support article on Apple.com called _Mac Basics_](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/) to get you started. Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the Python exercises on http://typing.io.

## GitHubbing to Know You

If you haven't already, [create a GitHub account](http://github.com/signup) (or use your existing one) and [edit your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile). Add a _recent, clear picture_ so we can recognize your face, _your full name_ so we can recognize your name, _a valid public email address_ so we can contact you. _Star the assignments repository_, if you haven't already.

### You've Got Issues

[Create an Issue in the assignments repo (this one)](../issues/new) and name it `00 -- Ready Steady Go -- YOUR NAME`, where `YOUR NAME` is, well... your name. Your real, full name. If you copy and paste the checklist from the **Tasks** sections below into the **Description** of your issue _as is_, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes thanks to [the way that GitHub interprets text](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete parts of the assignment, check off the corresponding checkboxes and watch your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in GitHub.

_This task list should be complete by the first day of class!_

### Send all my GitHub to you...

Finally, if you haven't guessed it yet, GitHub is a tool we'll use very heavily in the class and is highly respected in the industry. Learn all you can about `git` -- the command -- and GitHub! There are [some helpful Guides on GitHub](http://guides.github.com) to help you get started, but start with [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Fork-and-Spoon](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

## Command Line Training

In this class, we're going to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) _a lot_. Start with [_An Intro to the OS X Command Line_](http://eddywashere.com/blog/an-intro-to-the-os-x-command-line/) and [_Learn the Command Line_ on CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/). If you're looking for more of a challenge, you can try the [_CLI Crash Course_ by Zed Shaw](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

## Brewmaster

Throughout the course, we'll be using a lot of tools, some of them on day 1. _Please have these installed on your Mac before we get started on Monday!_ If you have trouble, please put a comment on your WIP Issue and notify us via email. _Don't stop!_

## Extracurricular Activities

You might notice by now that GitHub does something funny with the text that you write. It's using a simple formatting system called [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and it adds a little of its own flavor. To learn more about Markdown and how GitHub uses it, check out [_Explaining Markdown_ on Team Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/explaining-markdown) and [_Mastering Markdown_ on in the GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
