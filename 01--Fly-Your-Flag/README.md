## Code It

Draw a flag. Use colors, fills, strokes, whatever to make it look cool.

## Press the Issue

Submit your trinket like we submitted assignment 00.

## Hard mode

Put your flag drawing code in a function, and have that function take a parameter size that is used to change the size of the drawn flag. For example, canada(150) would draw the Canadian flag 150 pixels wide, while canada(30) would draw it only 30 pixels wide.
